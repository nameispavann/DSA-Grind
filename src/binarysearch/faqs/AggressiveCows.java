/**
 * The {@code AggressiveCows} class solves a classic binary search on answers problem: placing cows
 * in stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized.
 * <p>
 * Given the positions of stalls on a number line and a number of cows to place, the goal is to
 * place the cows in the stalls such that the smallest distance between any two cows is as large as possible.
 * This is achieved by performing a binary search over the range of possible distances (from 1 to
 * the maximum stall gap), and checking at each step if a given minimum distance is feasible.
 * <p>
 * This problem demonstrates how to apply binary search not on the array itself, but on the range of
 * possible answers â€” a technique commonly known as "binary search on answers."
 * <p>
 * In this problem we try to <b>maximize the minimum</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Example Use Case:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * int[] stallPositions = {0, 3, 4, 7, 10, 9};
 * int cows = 4;
 *
 * Arrays.sort(stallPositions); // Ensure the stall positions are sorted
 * int low = 1; // Low in binary search on answers always starts from 1. because in this problem, distance between cows cannot be zero
 * int high = stallPositions[stallPositions.length - 1] - stallPositions[0]; // high is nothing but max possible distance i.e.., last element - first element is the max possible distance between to cows. this is done to reduce the search range
 *
 * int result = findMaxPossibleMinDistance(stallPositions, cows, low, high);
 * System.out.println(result); // Outputs the maximum possible minimum distance
 * }</pre>
